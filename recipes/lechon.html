    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ½ pounds pork belly, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
        <li>2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>2 cups oil for frying, or as needed</li>
    </ul>

    <ol>
        <h3>Step 1</h3>
        <li>Combine pork belly, garlic, bay leaves, salt, and pepper in a skillet; pour in enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until skin is tender, 35 to 45 minutes. Drain and let sit at room temperature until pork has air-dried. 
        </li>

        <h3>Step 2</h3>
        <li>
            Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  
        </li>

        <h3>Step 3</h3>
        <li>
            Fry pork in the hot oil, working in batches, until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes. Remove fried pork with a slotted spoon and drain on a paper towel-lined plate. 
        </li>
    </ol>
